# Tadeucci - Dancing

## About

Change the intensity and style of your dances! Currently 210 dances available.

## How to Install

- Clone or Download the dancing folder. [https://github.com/angelotadeucci/Dances-FiveM/releases]

- Drop the folder in your FiveM Server Resources folder.

- Add the resource to your FiveM server.cfg file.

## Usage

Type /dance in chat. Use up and down arrow to change intensity, left and right arrow to go to next and previous dance. If the dance is controllable like (boxing, trip, jumper, shuffle, karate, monkey) use WASD to change the dancing style.

## Issues / Missing features

- Not all dances with props have the designated props.

- Usage could be lower if RegisterKeyMapping was used but I don't know if its worth adding 8 key bindings.

- Missing dances?!
